# ðŸš¨ FIXED DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

## What Was Fixed

1. Created simplified deployment scripts:
   - `deploy.sh` - Builds the app for production (run this first)
   - `start_production.sh` - Starts the app in production mode

2. Fixed Stripe integration to handle environment variables properly:
   - Now safely initializes the Stripe client
   - Better error handling for missing keys

3. Separated build and run steps for more reliable deployment

## For Replit Deployment

**Use this EXACT command in your Replit Deployment settings:**

```
NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js
```

## Steps to Deploy:

1. Build the production version:
   ```
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

2. In Replit Deployment tab:
   - Change run command to: `NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js`
   - Ensure STRIPE_SECRET_KEY is set in Secrets

3. Deploy from the Replit interface

## Testing Your Production Build Locally:

After building with `deploy.sh`, run:
```
./start_production.sh
```

This will run the application in production mode exactly as it would run when deployed.
